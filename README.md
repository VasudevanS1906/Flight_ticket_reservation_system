- Book a flight by providing passenger information (name, age, gender) and payment details (credit card or cash).
- Cancel an existing reservation.
- View the current list of reservations with passenger and payment details.
- Efficient data management using linked lists, queues, and stacks.
- User-friendly command-line interface for easy interaction.

# Documentation

The code is well-documented with comments explaining the purpose of each function, data structure, and variable. Additionally, a separate documentation file can be provided, detailing the system architecture, design decisions, and usage instructions.

# Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Compile the `main.c` file using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc main.c -o airline_reservation`).
3. Run the compiled executable (`./airline_reservation` on Unix-like systems or `airline_reservation.exe` on Windows).
